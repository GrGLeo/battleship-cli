# Battleship Game

Welcome to Battleship! This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic game Battleship, where you'll strategically deploy your fleet of ships and attempt to sink your opponent's ships before they sink yours.

## How to Play

1. **Setup**: Place your ships on the board by entering coordinates for each ship. Ships can be placed vertically or horizontally, but cannot overlap.

2. **Gameplay**: Take turns with your opponent firing shots at their ships. Try to guess where their ships are hidden and sink them all!

3. **Winning**: The game ends when one player's ships have all been sunk. If it's your opponent's ships that are all at the bottom of the sea, congratulationsâ€”you win!
